# House Price Prediction

# Description

Housing Prices Prediction is an essential element for an economy. Analysis of price ranges influence both sellers and buyers.Our project is mainly focused on prediction of prices against explanatory features that cover many aspects of houses. Also, this project creates a Linear Regression model to estimate the price of the house accurately with the given features.

# To Whom

'ImmoEliza' wants Belgium's House Prediction model to find and analyse the sales in Belgium.

# Objective

Be able to apply a linear regression in a real context & preprocess data for Machine Learning.

# How it Works?

We have collected the previously scraped, pre-processed  and analysed data. We again analysed the data for null values, how to handle categorical data, which features to be considered using Feature selection process etc. Once the final data is available, we have formatted by dividing into traning set and test set for machine to learn. Then, we tranined the model using machine learning algorithm which in this case is Linear Regression.

#### Data Understanding and Pre-processing

#### Feature Engineeing and Feature Selection

##### Steps performed:

1. Removed the features where the data was missing and irrelevant . 
2. Feature selection was done mostly using the Chi-squared contingency method which gives the list of features that are irrelevant for the model , and can be     
   removed from the dataframe. 
3. Utilising the pandas get_dummies class for one hot encoding on all the categorical columns to be used in the model.
